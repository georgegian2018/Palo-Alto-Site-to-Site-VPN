a Flask app that takes the headache out of VPN setup. No more manual tweaking or wrestling with firewalls. Just smooth, automated processes from start to finish.

You input the parameters, my app does the rest â€“ generating configs, pushing them to firewalls ( Palo Alto Firewalls), and even creating a neat PDF for your partners.
